          <p className="mb-4">
            The Information and Communication revolution has brought enormous
            changes in the way we organize our lives, our economies, industries
            and institutions. These spectacular developments in modern times
            have undoubtedly enhanced the quality of our lives, but at the same
            time, have led to manifold problems including the problem of massive
            amounts of hazardous waste and other waste generated from electric
            products. Such waste poses a serious threat to human health and the
            environment. The issue of proper management of such hazardous
            E-Waste is therefore critical to the protection of livelihood,
            health, and environment.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            To deal with this ever-rising problem of E-Waste, the government of
            India, through its Ministry of Environment and Forest, formulated
            the E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules in 2016.

            VigyBag's Commitment to E-Waste Management
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            VigyBag stands committed to implementing the E-Waste Management
            under the E-Waste Rules.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The Basel Convention defines wastes as "Substances or objects, which
            are disposed of or are intended to be disposed of, or are required
            to be disposed of by the provisions of national laws".
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            E-waste has been defined as "Waste electrical and electronic
            equipment, whole or in part or rejects from their manufacturing and
            repair process, which are intended to be discarded."
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Whereas, Electrical and electronic equipment has been defined as:
            "Equipment which is dependent on electrical currents or
            electro-magnetic fields to be fully functional".
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Like hazardous waste, the problem of e-waste has become an immediate
            and long-term concern as its unregulated accumulation and recycling
            can lead to major environmental problems endangering human health.
            This calls for an urgent need for E-Waste Management to preserve the
            ecological balance and reduce landfills. Recycling end-of-life
            products is vital if we are to save resources and minimize waste. In
            this regard, we at VigyBag have tied up with authorized E-Waste
            recyclers to facilitate our organization and our customers to enable
            them to dispose of E-Waste products after their end-of-life.

            </li>
            <li>
              - Oil & gases present in e-waste like compressors and CRTs cause
              environmental pollution.
            </li>
            <li>- Batteries contain highly hazardous elements.</li>
            <li>

          <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Recycle?</h2>
          <br />
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Conserve Resources:</strong>
              <br />
              Recycling saves the extraction of fresh raw resources and revives
              the existing ones that are no longer in use, thus reducing
              exploitation and conserving natural resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Save Energy:</strong>
              <br /> Recycling requires less energy than producing a new product
              from scratch, as it skips the processes of extraction,
              transportation, and refining of raw materials.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prevent Pollution:</strong>
              <br />
              By recycling, we cut down on the pollution of air, water, and
              land, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions and avoiding
              contributions to global warming.
